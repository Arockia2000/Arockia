# Requirements:
## Introduction
•	Unit conversion is a essential things in our day to day life. Everybody we will be involved in various types of unit conversions.It will be a hectic task to do those conversions manually.To solve this problem a simple c project is proposed.
•	In this project some of the basic unit conversions are performed.Some are temperature and currency conversions so on.

## Objectives
•	This project mainly focuses on temperature,currency and mass conversions.In temperature Celsius to fahrenhiet and vice-versa has been calculated

•	In currency USD to Euro and USD to japnese yen has been calculated.In mass conversions ounce to pounds and gram to pounds has been calculated

## Benefits
A user who is working in database who needs to know the conversion rates between different currencies can make use of this project. It is fast,simple and efficient.School students can use it for learning purposes.
## Cost and features
The cost of implementing project involving unit conversions is minimal.But the extensions of unit conversions as an mobile app requires knowledge in Android studio, high coding skills and so on.
## Defining our system
This system opens a compiler  page which asks the user which conversion needs to be done.The options available are temperature,currency and mass conversions. Different options are available within the sub options. A user can choose the conversion he want to perform. After the inputs are given the required result is printed on the output screen.
# SWOT Analysis:
## Strength:
•	To perform the required unit conversion faster and in a simpler manner

•	User friendly and free to use
## Weakness
•	Restricted to only limited conversion options

•	Limited number of operations defined
## Opportunities:
•	Opportunity to perform various unit conversions

•	Saves time from manual unit conversions

•	Simple and efficient solutions
## Threats:
•	Possible memory leaks

•	Availability of better options in market

# 4W’S and 1’H
## Who:
•	Students who want to learn unit conversions can use it.

•	Working professionals who want to know currency conversions of different countries

## What:
•	Calculate the necessary unit conversions required by user

•	Some of them are temperature,currency and mass

## Where:
•	Students facing a difficulty in unit conversions,they can use this program to confirm their outputs

•	Researchers can use it for getting a quick calculation output

## When:
•	Students,employees and researchers all over the world

## How:
•	The program can be executed in a system which has linux or windows operating system
